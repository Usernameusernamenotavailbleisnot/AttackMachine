# ⚔️ Attack Machine

![](https://github.com/realaskaer/Scroll/blob/master/data/preview.png)

## General Information

A very powerful tool in skilled hands. Almost completely automated. With this machine, you can manage a farm of any number of accounts across all supported networks. All settings are simple and intuitive, nothing excessive.
> The path will be mastered by the walker, and the software will be mastered by any degen 🕵️

***❗Thanks to the `AMOUNT_PERCENT` setting, the software itself decides what amount and which tokens will be used for module operation.
The machine considers % only for the native token `ETH`, other tokens (including LP tokens) are exchanged or withdrawn from pools at 100% of their balance.

## ♾️Main Functions

1.  **🤖Launch of all accounts with automatic route generation from Google Sheet**

    If you have prepared a spreadsheet and enabled services on Google Cloud API, the software will automatically generate routes for all accounts according to your settings and data from the spreadsheet.
    In the setup guide, you can find the **Google SpreadSheet** section, which describes in detail how to set everything up and includes a video guide. This is very useful if you control more than several hundred accounts.

2.  **🚀Launch of all accounts using prepared classic routes**

    After generating the route (Function #3), the software will start executing routes for all accounts. See all operation options in the **Software Configuration** section.

3.  **📄Generation of classic routes for each account**

    Classic generator, works using the old-school method. You need to specify lists of modules in the `CLASSIC_ROUTES_MODULES_USING` setting, and when launching this function, the software will create a route based on this setting. `None` is supported as one of the modules in the list, and when it appears in the route, the software will skip this list.

4. **💾Creating a dependency file for your OKX wallets**

    Creates a JSON file that links your addresses to OKX wallets. Made for your security. The software matches each line in `OKX address` to the same line in `Private Key`, and if you made a mistake, you can always check it in the `okx_withdraw_list.json` file to avoid wallet crossovers.

5. **✅Checking all proxies for functionality**

    Quick proxy check (really fast, like lightning)

6. **📊Getting statistics for each account**

    Almost instant retrieval of all statistics for accounts, even if there are more than 100 of them (don't forget about proxies). All necessary fields are included. *As of 02.12.2023, only supported for zkSync*

7. **⏰WHEN?**

## 📄Entering Your Data

### All necessary data must be specified in the `accounts_data` table in the `/data` folder. Each project requires its own separate sheet.
   1. **Name** - names of your accounts, each name must be unique
   2. **Private Key** - private keys to the wallets
   3. **Proxy** - proxy for each account. If there are fewer proxies than accounts, the software will cycle through them. If the proxies are mobile, you can specify just one proxy.
   4. **OKX address** - OKX deposit addresses. You must specify an address for each wallet, otherwise withdrawal will not work.
   5. **Private Key EVM** - private keys to EVM wallets. To bridge to Starknet, an EVM wallet is required. You can omit them, but bridges will not work.

You can set a password on your spreadsheet and enable the `EXCEL_PASSWORD = True` setting. When the password is activated, the software will require it to be entered for further work. Useful when working on a server.

## ⚙️Software Configuration

>I highly recommend reading this **[article](https://teletype.in/@realaskaer/attackmachine)**, which will help you configure any detail in the software.

All settings are in the `settings.py` file. Open it to see a detailed description of each section.
I'll duplicate the most important settings here.

1. The `API KEYS` section. Get all API keys. The section has links to websites where you need to do this.
2. The `GENERAL SETTINGS` section. Carefully read all descriptions and set the necessary values.
3. Then from top to bottom, configure all modules. Each module has a description.

### 📚Main Parameters

* `GLOBAL_NETWORK` - sets the main network for software operation
* `SOFTWARE_MODE` - determines the software operation mode (parallel or sequential). Parallel mode can simultaneously run a very large number of accounts (proxies are required for accounts, maximum 5-7 accounts per 1 proxy; if there are too few proxies, software operation will become unstable due to RPC limits). Sequential mode works like manual operation. Conditionally: deposit to account -> route completion -> withdrawal to OKX, and so on in a circle for all accounts.
* `ACCOUNTS_IN_STREAM` - sets the number of wallets in the stream during asynchronous launch (`SOFTWARE_MODE = 1`)
* `WALLETS_TO_WORK` - determines which wallets will work. Operation options: Single, Selection, From X to Y, All at once. More details in the settings.
* `SAVE_PROGRESS` - enables progress saving for accounts
* `TELEGRAM_NOTIFICATIONS` - enables Telegram notifications
* `SRC_CHAIN_ZERIUS`, `SRC_CHAIN_MERKLY`, `DST_CHAIN_ZERIUS_REFUEL`, `DST_CHAIN_MERKLY_REFUEL`, `DST_CHAIN_BUNGEE_REFUEL` and `DST_CHAIN_ZERIUS_NFT` - determine the outgoing/incoming blockchain (where to make refuel/bridge) and the minimum/maximum amount for refuel. You can also select multiple networks, and the software will choose one at random.
* `AMOUNT_PERCENT`, `LIQUIDITY_AMOUNT`, `TRANSFER_AMOUNT` - thanks to these parameters, the software understands what percentage of your balance it needs to use in modules for swaps, lending deposits, and adding liquidity. More details described [**here**](https://github.com/realaskaer/zkSync#%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B5-%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8)
* `MIN_BALANCE` - sets the minimum balance for an account, falling below which the software will give an error about insufficient balance on the account `Insufficient balance on account!`
* `GAS_CONTROL` - enables/disables gas control for each step in the route
* `GAS_MULTIPLIER` - gas multiplier, recommended values: Starknet - 1.2 to 1.5, Other networks - 1. This parameter is multiplied by the gas limit to increase the chance of successful transaction completion.
* `MAXIMUM_RETRY` - number of retries for errors in modules
* `PRICE_IMPACT` - determines the maximum % for Price Impact protection. If the Price Impact is greater, the module will stop the swap.
* `UNLIMITED_APPROVE` - choice between unlimited and exact approvals
* `SLEEP_MODE` and `SLEEP_TIME_STREAM` - enables/disables sleep mode after each module and between accounts. By enabling parallel mode and disabling this setting, you can witness the speed of this machine.
* `EXCEL_PASSWORD` - enables password request for the spreadsheet with account data
* `EXCEL_PAGE_NAME` - name of the sheet in the spreadsheet with account data

## 🤛🏻Referral Program

Inside the `config.py` file, there is a `HELP_SOFTWARE` setting. If it is enabled (by default - enabled), then 1% of your transaction amount on any aggregator (`ODOS`, `OpenOcean`, `1INCH`, `XYfinance`, `Rango`, `AVNU`) will go to me. This part of the transaction volume is transferred by the aggregator contract, not your wallet. Therefore, you will not be dealing with my wallet.
To disable this function, set the value to `False`
